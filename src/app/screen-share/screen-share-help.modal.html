<p>
sharing your screen is an experimental feature in webrtc and only works if
the browser you're using meets particular requirements.
</p>
<p>
active screen/window sharing will only work from firefox if you have at
least version 33 installed. in addition, two adjustments must be done in the
settings at <a href="about:config">about:config</a>. first, make sure
<code>media.getusermedia.screensharing.enabled</code> is enabled. then, make
sure <code>{{ vm.hostname() }}</code> is listed in
<code>media.getusermedia.screensharing.allowed_domains</code>.
</p>
<p>
if you're using a recent version of chrome (34+), you'll need to install
<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/janus-webrtc-screensharin/hapfgfdkleiggjjpfpenajgdnfckjpaj">this extension</a>.
if you're using an older verson of chrome, instead, you'll need to manually
enable the chrome flag
<a href="chrome://flags/#enable-usermedia-screen-capture">chrome://flags/#enable-usermedia-screen-capture</a>.
otherwise you'll get a permission error. moreover, please beware that some
versions of chrome may only	support the feature if you explicitly pass the
<code>--enable-usermedia-screen-capturing</code> parameter on the command
line.
