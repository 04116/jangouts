# Janus Hangouts

Janus Hangout is a solution for videoconferencing based on WebRTC and the
excelent [Janus Gateway](http://janus.conf.meetecho.com/) with a user interface
heavily inspired by Google Hangouts.

The development started during the 12th edition of
[SUSE's Hackweek](https://hackweek.suse.com/). The first prototype is already
fully functional supporting several concurrent users (only limited by the
bandwidth of the server), screen sharing and textual chat. In the upcoming weeks
the code will be polished and some documentation will be added, making easy for
anyone to enjoy a self-hosted open source alternative to Google Hangouts.
